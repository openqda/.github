# Security Policy

> Please do not open an issue for critical vulnerabilities! Please read below ðŸ‘‡

## Supported Versions

We are currently in a pre-release state and don't disclose our source.
This is not, because we don't want to, but because wa haven't 100% figured out organizational things, 
like choosing the right license, responsibilities etc.

We aim to disclose everything, once we reach the beta stage.
